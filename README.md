## How to Reproduce Results

All scripts are intended to be run **line by line in R**, not as batch jobs.  
The R scripts do **not** create intermediate files; instead, they display tables and plots interactively.  
Inline comments indicate which code blocks correspond to specific manuscript results.

---

### 1. Figures (Figure S1, Figures 2–7)

Each folder `figures/figure_*` contains:
- **`figure_*.R`** — R code for statistical analysis and visualization (run line by line).  
- **`figure_*.tex`** — LaTeX file that arranges multiple sub-figures into one composite figure.  
- **`tex/` subfolder** — LaTeX sources for each sub-figure (e.g., individual panels).

#### Workflow

1. **Run the R script line by line** in R to view analyses and plots.  
2. **Compile all `.tex` files** in the `tex/` subfolder to generate sub-figure PDFs.  
3. **Move or copy** the resulting PDFs into the same directory as `figure_*.tex`.  
4. **Compile** the main `figure_*.tex` to assemble the final composite figure.

```bash
# Example: Figure 2
Rscript figures/figure_2/figure_2.R

# Compile sub-figures
pdflatex figures/figure_2/tex/*.tex

# Move sub-figure PDFs next to figure_2.tex
mv figures/figure_2/tex/*.pdf figures/figure_2/

# Compile composite panel
pdflatex figures/figure_2/figure_2.tex
# or
latexmk -pdf figures/figure_2/figure_2.tex
```

Repeat for `figure_S1`, `figure_3`, …, `figure_7`.

### 2. Tables (Analyses for data1–data4)

Each folder `tables/table_k/` (for k = 1,…,4) contains R scripts that replicate the analyses for Tables 1–4.  
Execute each script **line by line** in R.  
Comments in the scripts indicate which code segments correspond to specific reported results.

---

### 3. Working Directory Setup

Before running any R script, set your working directory to where both the **data** and the **script** are located.

```r
# Example
setwd("/path/to/tables/table_1")
```

Or, in RStudio:

```
Session → Set Working Directory → To Source File Location
```

---

## Software Requirements

- **R** (version ≥ 4.0)  
- Common R packages listed in `library(...)` calls at the top of each `.R` file  
- (Optional) **renv** for reproducible environments:
  ```r
  install.packages("renv")
  renv::restore()
  ```
- **LaTeX** distribution (TeX Live or MiKTeX) with `pdflatex` or `latexmk` for compiling figures

## Data Access

The dataset is available upon request for research purposes.

- **Data queries:** [luoj1129@gmail.com](mailto:luoj1129@gmail.com)  
  Include the manuscript title and a short description of intended use.

> Some scripts will not run to completion without the data files (`tables/data1.csv`–`data4.csv`).  
> See `data_dictionary.pdf` for variable definitions and coding details.
